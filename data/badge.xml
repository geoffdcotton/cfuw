            <paragraph1 strParagraphDefault="visible" class="">On May 8, 2918, fifteen women met at what is now Nutana Collegiate. The result of this discussion was the formation of the University Women's Club of Saskatoon.  This program was to be a study of advancements made in the arts, sciences, and economics as well as a study of educational, social and community issues.</paragraph1>
            <paragraph2 class="">On October 20, 1919, the group worked to enter into association and to become charter members of the National Canadian Federation of University Women.</paragraph2>
            <paragraph3 strClassUnderSubheading="">All women who support the objectives of CFUW are urged to join this very successful club.</paragraph3>            
            <paragraph4 strClassLineItem4="">The group began very early to fund raise to assist women to attend and complete university degrees. CFUW Saskatoon holds a book sale yearly and uses the proceeds for scholarships for the University of Saskatchewan, bursaries for Saskatchewan Polytechnic and other community educational events and projects.</paragraph4>
            <paragraph5 strClassLineItem5="">The group has several interest and study groups and has a very active membership.</paragraph5>
